The component testing of the platform was performed only at an essential level, as reported in deliverable D3.2 \cite{INTERLACE_D32}, due to lack of time and funding. Although the basic testing of the CoreASIM model and the blockchain implementation both performed as required, we did not have time or resources to develop a production-level framework to test the components of the system formally and in an automated way against the requirements.

One possible way to do that will be to develop an ASIM-to-Gherkin compiler in order to run acceptance tests with Cucumber.\footnote{\url{https://docs.cucumber.io/}}  This work will be performed with own funds as a collaborative effort between SARDEX, SUAS, and the open source community at large. We expect the component testing to be completed sometime in 2019. All updates will be shared on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/InterlaceProject/InterlaceBlockchain}} and/or on the project's website.\footnote{\url{https://www.interlaceproject.eu/}}
